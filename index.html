    <h1>Hitless Runs</h1>
    <p>A <strong>No-Hit Run</strong> in the <strong>Soulsborne</strong> series is completing a game from start to finish without taking any <strong>hits</strong>. There are a number of different categories based on how much content in the game has been completed; this includes: Any% (minimum requirement for beating the game), All Vanilla Bosses (main game), and All Bosses (with DLCs). These runs are generally done without the use of quitouts and major skips/glitches (deathcams/out of bounds).</p>
